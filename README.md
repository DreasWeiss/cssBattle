my css battle practice

CSS Battle is an online game where two players use CSS styling and HTML coding techniques to create the most attractive website design. The goal of each player is to out-style their opponent by creating a more visually appealing webpage using only CSS code, while also following certain rules set forth in order for them to win. Players can watch live as their designs are critiqued and judged against one another with the ultimate winner receiving recognition on the site's leaderboard.
